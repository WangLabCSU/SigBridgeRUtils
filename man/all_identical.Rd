\title{Check all the Objects Are Identical}
\usage{
all_identical(..., names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Objects to compare for identity}

\item{names}{Optional character vector of names for the objects. If not provided,
objects will be named as "Obj1", "Obj2", etc.}
}
\value{
A symmetric logical matrix where entry [i, j] indicates whether
object i is identical to object j. The matrix has dimensions n x n where
n is the number of objects, with row and column names from the names parameter.
}
\description{
all_identical checks if all provided objects are pairwise identical and returns
a symmetric matrix showing the comparison results between all object pairs.
}
\details{
This function provides a comprehensive way to compare multiple objects at once,
returning a matrix that shows all pairwise comparisons. This is particularly
useful for testing and validation scenarios where you need to verify that
multiple objects are identical.
}
\examples{
# Compare identical objects
x <- 1:5
y <- 1:5
z <- 1:5

# All objects are identical
result <- all_identical(x, y, z)
print(result)

# Compare different objects with custom names
a <- 1:3
b <- 1:5
c <- 1:3

result2 <- all_identical(a, b, c, names = c("first", "second", "third"))
print(result2)

# Single object case
single_result <- all_identical(x)
print(single_result)
